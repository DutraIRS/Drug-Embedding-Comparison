## Reproducibility
To reproduce the results, you will need to install the required packages. You can do this by running the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To check the code tests, you can reproduce the pytest results and coverage report by running the following command:
```bash
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing --cov-report=html
```
The coverage report will be available in the `htmlcov` folder. Just open the `index.html` file in your browser.
